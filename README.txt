Personal Project: Angry Birds Game

Description:
This project is an advanced implementation of the popular Angry Birds game using p5.js and Matter.js libraries. The game features a slingshot mechanism, destructible boxes, scoring for hitting pigs, dynamic background changes based on the time of day using the World Time API, and enhanced error handling.

Skills Highlighted:
JavaScript: Proficiency in JavaScript for game logic and asynchronous operations.
p5.js Library: Utilized for creating the game canvas, handling graphics, and user interactions.
Matter.js Library: Employed for physics simulations, including the movement and collisions of game elements.
Asynchronous JavaScript (Async/Await): Demonstrated in the getBackgroundImg function for fetching and loading the background image asynchronously.
API Integration: Integrated the World Time API to dynamically change the game background based on the time of day.
Error Handling: Implemented error handling to gracefully manage failures during API calls or image loading.
Game Development: Developed game mechanics such as slingshot controls, bird trajectory, destructible objects, scoring, and dynamic background changes.

Features:
Dynamic Background: The game background changes based on the time of day, creating a more immersive gaming experience.
Scoring System: Implemented a scoring system that updates based on the player's performance.
Error Handling: Incorporated error handling to gracefully handle issues during API calls or image loading, improving the game's robustness.
Responsive Design: The game canvas adjusts to different screen sizes, providing a seamless user experience.
Interactive Slingshot: Users can drag and release the bird using mouse interactions, simulating the Angry Birds slingshot mechanism.

How to Run:
Open the project files in any code editor.
Ensure an internet connection for background image fetching.
Open the HTML file in a web browser.

Controls:
Drag Mouse: Adjust the slingshot aiming direction.
Release Mouse: Launch the bird.
Spacebar: Reset the game, bringing the bird back to the slingshot.

Error Handling:
The game gracefully handles errors during API calls or image loading, ensuring a smooth gaming experience even in challenging network conditions.

Future Enhancements:
Implement additional levels with varying difficulty.
Add more elements such as power-ups and obstacles.
Enhance graphics and animations for a more immersive experience.
